## Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to perform and interpret t-tests in R. Every part follows the same **3-step cycle**:

1. **Watch** - Follow along with the instructor slides (embedded below)
2. **Try** - Practice with interactive code cells on the activity page
3. **Do** - Complete exercises in your downloaded notebook in RStudio Server

Work through each part in order, and don't skip steps!

## T-Test Adventure

Build your intuition before diving into code! This interactive app lets you experiment with sample sizes, means, and standard deviations to see how they affect t-test results.

## ![](/assets/images/svg/target.svg){width=24} Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Explain the logic of null hypothesis significance testing
- Choose the appropriate t-test for different research designs
- Conduct a one-sample t-test using `t.test()`
- Conduct an independent samples t-test comparing two groups
- Conduct a paired samples t-test for pre-post designs
- Calculate and interpret Cohen's d effect sizes
- Check assumptions for t-tests
- Write APA-style results for t-tests

## The Data Story

We've collected data from a Test Anxiety intervention study:

- **80 university students** completed the Test Anxiety Inventory
- Participants were assigned to either **Control** or **Intervention** groups
- Anxiety was measured **before and after** the intervention
- The population mean for this scale is known to be **50**

**Our research questions**:
1. Does our sample differ from the population norm?
2. Do the groups differ at baseline?
3. Did anxiety change from pre to post?
