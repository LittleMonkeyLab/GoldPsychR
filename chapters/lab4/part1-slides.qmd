## Today's Dataset {.center background-color="#27AE60"}

We've collected **Student Wellbeing** data:

-   **100 students** in a wellbeing study
-   Variables: age, stress, sleep hours, exercise minutes
-   **Outcome**: Wellbeing score (0-100)

---

## Today's Research Questions

**Questions**:

1. Is stress related to wellbeing?
2. Does sleep predict wellbeing?
3. Can we predict wellbeing from multiple factors?

---

## From Comparison to Relationship

So far we've asked: **Do groups differ?**

Now we ask: **Are variables related?**

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**T-tests/ANOVA**

- Compare group means
- Categorical IV → Continuous DV
- "Is there a difference?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Correlation/Regression**

- Examine relationships
- Continuous IV → Continuous DV
- "Is there an association?"
:::
::::

---

## Types of Relationships

**Positive relationship**: As X increases, Y increases

**Negative relationship**: As X increases, Y decreases

**No relationship**: No consistent pattern

### {{< fa code >}} Interactive

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# Positive relationship
x1 <- 1:20
y1 <- x1 + rnorm(20, 0, 2)
plot(x1, y1, main = "Positive Relationship",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

### {{< fa file-code >}} Static

```{webr-r}
#| autorun: true
#| read-only: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
set.seed(42)
x1 <- 1:20
y1 <- x1 + rnorm(20, 0, 2)
plot(x1, y1, main = "Positive Relationship",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

## Correlation vs Regression

| Aspect | Correlation | Regression |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Measure association | Predict outcomes |
| **Statistic** | r (correlation) | β (slope) |
| **Direction** | Symmetric | X predicts Y |
| **Use case** | Describe relationships | Make predictions |

---

## The Correlation Coefficient (r)

Pearson's r measures **linear** relationship strength:

$$r = \frac{\sum(X - \bar{X})(Y - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum(X - \bar{X})^2 \sum(Y - \bar{Y})^2}}$$

**Range**: -1 to +1

-   **r = 1**: Perfect positive
-   **r = 0**: No linear relationship
-   **r = -1**: Perfect negative

---

## Interpreting r

| |r| | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| 0.00 - 0.10 | Negligible |
| 0.10 - 0.30 | Small |
| 0.30 - 0.50 | Medium |
| 0.50 - 1.00 | Large |

## Linear Regression {.center background-color="#27AE60"}

Regression finds the **best-fitting line**:

$$Y = b_0 + b_1X + \epsilon$$

-   **b₀**: Intercept (Y when X = 0)
-   **b₁**: Slope (change in Y per unit X)
-   **ε**: Error (residuals)

---

## What Regression Does

1. Finds the line that **minimizes squared errors**
2. Tells us **how much** Y changes with X
3. Allows us to **predict** Y from X
4. Tests if the relationship is **significant**

---

## Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **R²** | Proportion of variance explained |
| **Slope (b₁)** | Change in Y per unit X |
| **Intercept (b₀)** | Y when X = 0 |
| **Residuals** | Prediction errors |

---

## Summary: Part 1 {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

Key concepts:

-   **Correlation** measures association strength
-   **r** ranges from -1 to +1
-   **Regression** predicts Y from X
-   The **slope** tells us how much Y changes with X
-   **R²** tells us variance explained
