## Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to compare three or more groups using ANOVA. Every part follows the same **3-step cycle**:

1. **Watch** - Follow along with the instructor slides (embedded below)
2. **Try** - Practice with interactive code cells on the activity page
3. **Do** - Complete exercises in your downloaded notebook in RStudio Server

Work through each part in order, and don't skip steps!

## ![](/assets/images/svg/target.svg){width=24} Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Explain when to use ANOVA instead of t-tests
- Conduct a one-way ANOVA using `aov()`
- Interpret F-ratios and p-values from ANOVA output
- Conduct Tukey's HSD post-hoc comparisons
- Conduct a two-way (factorial) ANOVA
- Identify and interpret main effects and interactions
- Calculate and interpret eta-squared (η²)
- Write APA-style ANOVA results

## The Data Story

We've collected data from a Study Techniques experiment:

- **120 university students** participated in a memory test
- Students used one of **three study methods**: Rereading, Self-Testing, or Elaboration
- Half studied in the **Morning**, half in the **Evening**
- Outcome: Number of items correctly recalled (0-30)

**Our research questions**:
1. Do the three study methods differ in effectiveness?
2. Does time of day affect memory performance?
3. Is there an interaction between study method and time of day?

## The Testing Effect

Research consistently shows that self-testing is more effective than rereading for long-term retention - this is called the "testing effect."
