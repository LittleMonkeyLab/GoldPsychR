## The Data Story

Over the next **4 weeks**, we'll work through a complete research workflow:

- **Week 1**: Describe and visualise your data
- **Week 2**: Compare groups with t-tests
- **Week 3**: Compare multiple groups with ANOVA
- **Week 4**: Explore relationships with correlation & regression

## Today's Dataset

We've collected **Big Five personality data** from a training study:

- 160 participants completed personality questionnaires
- Half received a training intervention, half were controls
- Measured before (pre) and after (post) the intervention

**Our question**: Did the training affect personality scores?

## What is R?

**R** is a programming language designed for statistics and data analysis.

- **Free** and **open source** - anyone can use it
- Created by statisticians, for statisticians
- Thousands of packages for specialised analyses
- The standard in psychology, biology, and social sciences

## Why R (not SPSS)?

| R | SPSS |
|---|------|
| Free forever | Expensive licence |
| Code is reproducible | Point-and-click is hard to repeat |
| Cutting-edge methods | Lags behind |
| Used in academia & industry | Mainly academia |

**Learning R is an investment in your future career.**

## RStudio: Your R Workspace

**RStudio** is an application that makes R easier to use.

Think of it like this:

- **R** = the engine
- **RStudio** = the car dashboard

You'll work in RStudio, but R does the actual computing.

## The Four Panes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Top-Left: Source**

- Where you write scripts
- Save your work here

**Bottom-Left: Console**

- Where code runs
- Immediate feedback
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Top-Right: Environment**

- Your data and objects
- Watch it update!

**Bottom-Right: Files/Plots/Help**

- Navigate files
- View outputs

## RStudio in Action

![RStudio IDE](../../labs/images/rstudio.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

---

## Your First Code

Try this in the Console:

```{webr-r}
1 + 1
```

R returned the answer! The `[1]` just means "first result".

---

## Creating Variables

We store values using the **assignment operator** `<-`

```{webr-r}
x <- 5
y <- 2
x + y
```

Watch the **Environment pane** update when you create variables!

---

## Vectors: Multiple Values

A **vector** is a collection of values. Create them with `c()`:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
scores
```

---

## Basic Functions

R has built-in functions for statistics:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
mean(scores)
sd(scores)
length(scores)
```

---

## Common Error: Object Not Found

```r
z + 1
```

```
Error: object 'z' not found
```

**Fix:** Create the object first!

```{webr-r}
z <- 10
z + 1
```

---

## Summary: Part 1

You learned:

- What R and RStudio are
- How to navigate the four panes
- How to create variables with `<-`
- How to create vectors with `c()`
- How to use functions like `mean()`, `sd()`
