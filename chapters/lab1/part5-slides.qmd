## Why APA Style?

**American Psychological Association** style ensures:

- Consistency across publications
- Easy comparison of results
- Professional presentation

---

## The Key Components

When reporting descriptive statistics:

- **M** = Mean
- **SD** = Standard Deviation
- **n** = Sample size

Always report all three!

---

## Formatting Numbers

**Rules:**

- Round to **2 decimal places**
- Use *M* and *SD* in italics
- Include sample sizes

**Example:**

> *M* = 3.27, *SD* = 0.70, *n* = 40

---

## Getting Your Numbers

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)

data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reverse-score items
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6

# Create subscales
data$consistency <- data$rev_G1 + data$rev_G3 + data$rev_G5 + data$rev_G6
data$perseverance <- data$G2 + data$G4 + data$G7 + data$G8
data$Study_Year <- factor(data$Study_Year)

data |>
  group_by(Study_Year) |>
  summarise(
    M_consistency = round(mean(consistency), 2),
    SD_consistency = round(sd(consistency), 2),
    M_perseverance = round(mean(perseverance), 2),
    SD_perseverance = round(sd(perseverance), 2),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

---

## Template Structure

A good descriptive results paragraph has:

1. **Overall description** (M, SD for whole sample)
2. **Group comparison** (how do study years differ?)
3. **Subscale comparison** (Consistency vs Perseverance)
4. **Interpretation** (what does this suggest?)

---

## Example Paragraph

> Participants reported moderate levels of Consistency of Interest overall (*M* = 12.45, *SD* = 2.38) and Perseverance of Effort (*M* = 13.21, *SD* = 2.15). First-year students showed lower Consistency of Interest scores (*M* = 11.89, *SD* = 2.41, *n* = 60) compared to final-year students (*M* = 13.01, *SD* = 2.28, *n* = 60). For Perseverance of Effort, first-year students (*M* = 12.95, *SD* = 2.18) showed similar scores to final-year students (*M* = 13.47, *SD* = 2.11). These descriptive patterns suggest that consistency of interest may develop with academic experience, while perseverance remains relatively stable.

## Common Mistakes

❌ "The mean was 3.27234567"

✓ "The mean was 3.27"

❌ "M = 3.27"

✓ "*M* = 3.27"

❌ "First-year students had higher scores"

✓ "First-year students (*M* = 11.89) had lower Consistency of Interest scores than final-year students (*M* = 13.01)"

---

## Using knitr::kable()

Make nice tables:

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)

data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reverse-score items
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6

# Create subscales
data$consistency <- data$rev_G1 + data$rev_G3 + data$rev_G5 + data$rev_G6
data$perseverance <- data$G2 + data$G4 + data$G7 + data$G8
data$Study_Year <- factor(data$Study_Year)

summary_table <- data |>
  group_by(Study_Year) |>
  summarise(
    M_consistency = round(mean(consistency), 2),
    SD_consistency = round(sd(consistency), 2),
    M_perseverance = round(mean(perseverance), 2),
    SD_perseverance = round(sd(perseverance), 2),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

knitr::kable(summary_table, 
             caption = "Descriptive Statistics for Grit Subscales by Study Year",
             col.names = c("Study Year", "M (Consistency)", "SD (Consistency)", 
                          "M (Perseverance)", "SD (Perseverance)", "n"))
```

## Summary: Part 5

You learned:

- APA style for reporting M, SD, n
- How to structure a results paragraph
- How to create formatted tables
- Common formatting mistakes to avoid

---

## Lab 1 Complete!

You've learned:

1. **R basics** - variables, vectors, functions
2. **Loading data** - read_csv(), head(), str()
3. **Reverse scoring** - the 6 - x formula
4. **Descriptives** - group_by(), summarise()
5. **APA reporting** - professional write-ups

**Next week:** Comparing groups with t-tests!

## Tips
- Copy numbers directly from your summary table
- Use the template as a starting point
- Always include M, SD, and n
