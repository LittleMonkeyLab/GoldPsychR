## Why APA Style?

**American Psychological Association** style ensures:

- Consistency across publications
- Easy comparison of results
- Professional presentation

---

## The Key Components

When reporting descriptive statistics:

- **M** = Mean
- **SD** = Standard Deviation
- **n** = Sample size

Always report all three!

---

## Formatting Numbers

**Rules:**

- Round to **2 decimal places**
- Use *M* and *SD* in italics
- Include sample sizes

**Example:**

> *M* = 3.27, *SD* = 0.70, *n* = 40

---

## Getting Your Numbers

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/personality_lab.csv"
data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)
data$rev_p4 <- 6 - data$p4
data$rev_p5 <- 6 - data$p5
data$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 + data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5

data |>
  group_by(group, time) |>
  summarise(
    M = round(mean(pers_score), 2),
    SD = round(sd(pers_score), 2),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

---

## Template Structure

A good descriptive results paragraph has:

1. **Overall description** (M, SD for whole sample)
2. **Baseline comparison** (were groups similar?)
3. **Post-intervention comparison** (what changed?)
4. **Interpretation** (what does this suggest?)

---

## Example Paragraph

> Participants reported moderate levels of personality overall (*M* = 15.23, *SD* = 2.45). At baseline, the control group (*M* = 15.10, *SD* = 2.38, *n* = 40) and training group (*M* = 15.36, *SD* = 2.52, *n* = 40) showed similar scores. Following the intervention, the control group showed little change (*M* = 15.15, *SD* = 2.41), whereas the training group showed an increase (*M* = 16.89, *SD* = 2.21). These descriptive patterns suggest a potential training effect.

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ "The mean was 3.27234567"

✓ "The mean was 3.27"

❌ "M = 3.27"

✓ "*M* = 3.27"

❌ "Group 1 had higher scores"

✓ "The training group (*M* = 16.89) had higher scores than the control group (*M* = 15.15)"

---

## Using knitr::kable()

Make nice tables:

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/personality_lab.csv"
data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)
data$rev_p4 <- 6 - data$p4
data$rev_p5 <- 6 - data$p5
data$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 + data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5

summary_table <- data |>
  group_by(group, time) |>
  summarise(
    M = round(mean(pers_score), 2),
    SD = round(sd(pers_score), 2),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

knitr::kable(summary_table, caption = "Descriptive Statistics")
```

## Summary: Part 5

You learned:

- APA style for reporting M, SD, n
- How to structure a results paragraph
- How to create formatted tables
- Common formatting mistakes to avoid

---

## Lab 1 Complete!

You've learned:

1. **R basics** - variables, vectors, functions
2. **Loading data** - read_csv(), head(), str()
3. **Reverse scoring** - the 6 - x formula
4. **Descriptives** - group_by(), summarise()
5. **APA reporting** - professional write-ups

**Next week:** Comparing groups with t-tests!

## Tips
- Copy numbers directly from your summary table
- Use the template as a starting point
- Always include M, SD, and n
