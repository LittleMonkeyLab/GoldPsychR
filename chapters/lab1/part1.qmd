## Try It Yourself

Now practice what you just learned! The code cells below are **interactive** - you can edit them directly on this page.

::: {.callout-tip}
## How to Practice
1. **Click "Run Code"** to execute the code and see the result
2. **Edit the code directly** - click inside the code box, change numbers or add new lines, then click "Run Code" again
3. **Experiment freely** - try different values, create your own variables, and see what happens!

You're running R code right here in your browser - no need to switch to RStudio yet!
:::

### Basic Calculations

R works like a calculator. **Click "Run Code"** below, then **edit the numbers** and run again:

```{webr-r}
1 + 1
```

What about more complex maths? **Try changing the numbers** in this code:

```{webr-r}
10 * 5 + 2
```

### Creating Variables

Use the assignment operator `<-` to store values. **Edit the values** below and see what happens:

```{webr-r}
x <- 5
y <- 3
x + y
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Challenge
**Edit the code above** to create a variable called `age` and set it to your age. Then add a line to create `next_year` that adds 1 to it. Click "Run Code" to see your results!
:::

### Creating Vectors

A vector holds multiple values. Create one with `c()`. **Try adding more numbers** to the vector:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
scores
```

### Using Functions

Calculate descriptive statistics. **Edit the scores** in the code below and run again:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
mean(scores)
```

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
sd(scores)
```

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
length(scores)
```

## Self-Assessment

Check your understanding before moving on.

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}

**1. What symbol is used to assign a value to a variable in R?**

`r mcq(c("=", answer = "<-", "->", "=="))`

**2. What function creates a vector of multiple values?**

`r mcq(c("vector()", "v()", answer = "c()", "combine()"))`

**3. The mean of `c(2, 4, 6)` is `r fitb("4")`.**

**4. True or False: R is free and open source.**

`r torf(TRUE)`

**5. True or False: RStudio and R are the same thing.**

`r torf(FALSE)`

## Download Exercise

Ready to practice in RStudio? Follow these steps carefully:

### ![](/assets/images/svg/download.svg){width=24} Step 1: Download the File

Click the button below to download the exercise notebook:

```{r}
#| echo: false
downloadthis::download_file(
  path = "../../templates/lab1-exercise.qmd",
  output_name = "lab1-exercise",
  button_label = "Download Exercise (.qmd)",
  button_type = "warning",
  icon = "fa fa-download",
  class = "btn-lg"
)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Where Did It Go?

The file `lab1-exercise.qmd` will download to your **Downloads folder** (or wherever your browser saves downloads).

**Can't find it?**
- Check your browser's download bar (usually at the bottom)
- Look in your Downloads folder: `~/Downloads/` (Mac) or `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\` (Windows)
- Check your browser settings to see where downloads are saved
:::

### Step 2: Open RStudio Server

1. Go to [RStudio Server](https://psy909.gold.ac.uk/rstudioserver/)
2. Log in with your Goldsmiths credentials

::: {.callout-important}
## Login Format

**Important:** Use your full campus email address format:

- Format: `yourusername@campus.goldsmiths.ac.uk`
- Example: `jbond007@campus.goldsmiths.ac.uk`
- **Not** just `jbond007` or `jbond007@gold.ac.uk`

Use the same username and password you use for other Goldsmiths systems.
:::

3. Wait for RStudio to load (this may take 10-30 seconds)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Troubleshooting RStudio Access

**Can't log in?**

- Make sure you're using the full `@campus.goldsmiths.ac.uk` format
- Double-check your username and password
- Try clearing your browser cache
- Contact IT support if login issues persist

**Page won't load?**

- Check your internet connection
- Try a different browser (Chrome or Firefox work best)
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
:::

### Step 3: Create a Project Folder

1. In RStudio, look at the **Files** tab in the bottom-right pane
2. Click **New Folder** (or right-click and select "New Folder")
3. Name it `RLab1` (or `Lab1` - choose something you'll remember)
4. **Double-click** the folder to open it

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why Create a Folder?

Keeping your work organized helps you:

- Find files easily
- Avoid confusion between different labs
- Keep your workspace tidy
- Submit assignments correctly
:::

### Step 4: Upload the File

1. Make sure you're **inside** your `RLab1` folder (check the path at the top of the Files pane)
2. Click the **Upload** button (looks like an arrow pointing up)
3. Click **Choose File** and navigate to your Downloads folder
4. Select `lab1-exercise.qmd`
5. Click **OK** to upload

::: {.callout-warning}
## Upload Problems?

**File won't upload?**
- Check the file size (should be small, < 50KB)
- Make sure you selected the `.qmd` file (not a `.html` or other file)
- Try refreshing the page and uploading again
- Check your internet connection

**File uploaded but can't see it?**
- Make sure you're in the correct folder (check the path)
- Click the refresh button (circular arrow) in the Files pane
- Look for `lab1-exercise.qmd` - it should appear in the file list
:::

### Step 5: Open the File

1. In the Files pane, **click** on `lab1-exercise.qmd`
2. The file will open in the **Source** pane (top-left)
3. You're ready to start working!

::: {.callout-tip}
## What You'll See

When you open the `.qmd` file, you'll see:

- **YAML header** at the top (between `---` lines) - metadata about the document
- **Markdown text** explaining what to do
- **Code chunks** (gray boxes) with R code
- Green "play" buttons to run each code chunk

**Next:** Complete your first task below!
:::

## Your First Task: Change Your Name and Render

Now that you have the notebook open, let's do something **really simple** to make sure everything works:

### Step 1: Find Your Name

1. Look at the **very top** of the file (lines 1-5)
2. You'll see something like this:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics"
   subtitle: "Grit & The Short Grit Scale"
   author: "YOUR NAME HERE"
   date: today
   ```
3. **Find line 4** where it says `author: "YOUR NAME HERE"`

### Step 2: Replace with Your Name

1. **Click** on `"YOUR NAME HERE"` 
2. **Type** your actual name (keep the quotation marks!)
3. For example: `author: "Jane Smith"` or `author: "Alex Johnson"`

### Step 3: Render Your Notebook

1. **Look at the top toolbar** in RStudio Server
2. **Find the Render button** - it looks like a knitting needle or ball of yarn 🧶
3. **Click the Render button**
4. Wait a few seconds... RStudio will process your file
5. When it's done, a **preview window** will open showing your rendered HTML document
6. **Check the top** - you should see your name in the document header!

![Render button location in RStudio Server toolbar](images/Render.png)

::: {.callout-success}
## Success!

If you see your name in the rendered HTML document, **congratulations!** You've just:
- ✅ Edited a Quarto document
- ✅ Rendered it to HTML
- ✅ Created your first output file

This is exactly how you'll work throughout the lab. Make changes → Render → See results!
:::

**What happened?** The Render button converted your `.qmd` file into a beautiful HTML document. Every time you make changes and render, you create a new version with your latest work. This is how you'll submit your assignments!
