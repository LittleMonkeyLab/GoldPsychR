## Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to analyse Grit Scale data in R. Every part follows the same **3-step cycle**:

1. **Watch** - Follow along with the instructor slides (embedded below)
2. **Try** - Practice with interactive code cells on the activity page
3. **Do** - Complete exercises in your downloaded notebook in RStudio Server

Work through each part in order, and don't skip steps!

## ![](/assets/images/svg/target.svg){width=24} Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Navigate RStudio and understand its four panes
- Load CSV data into R using `read_csv()`
- Reverse-score negatively worded questionnaire items (4 items: G1, G3, G5, G6)
- Calculate subscale scores (Consistency of Interest, Perseverance of Effort)
- Calculate descriptive statistics by group using `dplyr`
- Create boxplots using `ggplot2`
- Write an APA-style results paragraph

## The Data Story

We've collected data using the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S):

- **120 university students** completed the 8-item Grit Scale
- Participants are either **First Year** or **Final Year** students
- The scale measures two subscales: Consistency of Interest and Perseverance of Effort

**Our research question**: Do grit scores differ between first-year and final-year students?
