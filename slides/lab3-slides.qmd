## Lab 3 Preview {.center}

**Week 3: ANOVA**

---

## Today's Lab Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours

**Dataset:** Experimental Data (n=150)

**What we'll do:**

- One-way ANOVA
- Post-hoc comparisons
- Effect sizes (eta-squared)
- Two-way ANOVA (factorial designs)

---

## When to Use ANOVA

**t-test:** Compare 2 groups

**ANOVA:** Compare 3+ groups

Why not multiple t-tests?
- Inflates Type I error rate
- ANOVA controls family-wise error

---

## Part 1: One-Way ANOVA

**Time:** 30 minutes

Compare three or more groups:

```r
# Fit the model
model <- aov(score ~ condition, data = mydata)

# View results
summary(model)
```

---

## Reading ANOVA Output

```
            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)
condition    2   1250   625.0   12.5  0.0001 ***
Residuals   97   4850    50.0
```

Key values:
- F-statistic
- p-value
- Degrees of freedom

---

## Part 2: Post-Hoc Tests

**Time:** 30 minutes

Which groups differ?

```r
# Tukey's HSD
TukeyHSD(model)

# Or pairwise t-tests with correction
pairwise.t.test(data$score, data$condition,
                p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

---

## Part 3: Effect Sizes

**Time:** 30 minutes

Calculate eta-squared:

```r
library(effectsize)
eta_squared(model)
```

| η² value | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| 0.01 | Small |
| 0.06 | Medium |
| 0.14 | Large |

---

## Part 4: Two-Way ANOVA

**Time:** 30 minutes

Factorial designs with two IVs:

```r
model <- aov(score ~ factor_a * factor_b, data = mydata)
summary(model)
```

Tests:
- Main effect of A
- Main effect of B
- A × B interaction

---

## Interpreting Interactions

When the effect of one IV depends on the level of another:

```r
# Visualise the interaction
interaction.plot(data$factor_a, data$factor_b, data$score)

# Or with ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor_a, y = score, colour = factor_b)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", aes(group = factor_b))
```

---

## APA Reporting

> A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of condition on scores, *F*(2, 97) = 12.50, *p* < .001, η² = .21.

> Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey's HSD indicated that...

- Run one-way ANOVA
- Conduct post-hoc comparisons
- Calculate and interpret effect sizes
- Run and interpret two-way ANOVA
