## Today's Dataset

We've collected **Test Anxiety** data from university students:

-   **80 students** completed the Test Anxiety Inventory
-   Participants in **Control** or **Intervention** groups
-   Anxiety measured **before and after** intervention
-   Population mean is known to be **50**

**Our research questions:**

1. Does our sample differ from the population norm?
2. Do the groups differ at baseline and post-test?
3. Did anxiety change from pre to post?

## The Five Parts

| Part | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Introduction | Hypotheses, test selection |
| 2 | One-Sample T-Test | `t.test(x, mu = )` |
| 3 | Independent Samples | `t.test(y ~ group)` |
| 4 | Paired Samples | `t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)` |
| 5 | Effect Sizes & Reporting | Cohen's d, APA format |

---

# Part 1: Introduction to T-Tests {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

---

## What is a T-Test?

A **t-test** compares means to determine if differences are **statistically significant**.

-   One of the most common statistical tests in psychology
-   Accounts for sample size and variability
-   Key question: Is the observed difference larger than chance?

---

## The Logic of Hypothesis Testing

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

- States "no effect" or "no difference"
- What we assume is true unless evidence suggests otherwise
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**

- States there IS an effect or difference
- What we're trying to find evidence for
:::
::::

**We test if data provide enough evidence to reject H₀**

---

## P-Values Explained

> "If the null hypothesis were true, what's the probability of getting results at least this extreme?"

-   **p < .05**: Statistically significant
-   **p ≥ .05**: Not statistically significant

::: {.callout-important}
p < .05 doesn't mean "true" - it means "unlikely if H₀ were true"
:::

---

## Three Types of T-Tests

| Test | Use When | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **One-Sample** | Compare sample to known value | Is mean different from 50? |
| **Independent** | Compare two separate groups | Control vs. Intervention |
| **Paired** | Compare related measurements | Before vs. After |

---

# Part 2: One-Sample T-Test {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

---

## One-Sample T-Test

**Purpose**: Compare a sample mean to a known population value

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ = sample mean
- $\mu_0$ = population mean
- $s$ = sample SD
- $n$ = sample size

---

## The R Code

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/test_anxiety_data.csv"
anxiety_data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)

# One-sample t-test: Is mean different from 50?
t.test(anxiety_data$anxiety_pre, mu = 50)
```

---

## Reading the Output

Key values to report:

-   **t** = test statistic
-   **df** = degrees of freedom (n - 1)
-   **p-value** = probability value
-   **95% CI** = confidence interval

**Decision**: If p < .05, reject H₀

---

# Part 3: Independent Samples T-Test {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

---

## Independent Samples T-Test

**Purpose**: Compare means of **two different groups**

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{SE_{difference}}$$

-   **Welch's test** (default): Does NOT assume equal variances
-   **Student's test**: Assumes equal variances

---

## The R Code

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/test_anxiety_data.csv"
anxiety_data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Compare groups at post-test
t.test(anxiety_post ~ group, data = anxiety_data)
```

---

## The Formula Syntax

```r
t.test(outcome ~ grouping_variable, data = dataframe)
```

This reads: "Test if **outcome** differs by **group**"

Examples:
- `anxiety_post ~ group`
- `exam_score ~ condition`
- `reaction_time ~ treatment`

---

# Part 4: Paired Samples T-Test {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

---

## Paired Samples T-Test

**Purpose**: Compare two related measurements from **same people**

$$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$$

-   Tests if mean difference ≠ 0
-   More powerful than independent t-test
-   Each person is their own control

---

## The R Code

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/test_anxiety_data.csv"
anxiety_data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Paired t-test: pre vs post
t.test(anxiety_data$anxiety_pre, anxiety_data$anxiety_post, paired = TRUE)
```

**Key**: `paired = TRUE` is essential!

---

## By Group

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/test_anxiety_data.csv"
anxiety_data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Intervention group only
intervention <- anxiety_data[anxiety_data$group == "intervention", ]
t.test(intervention$anxiety_pre, intervention$anxiety_post, paired = TRUE)
```

---

# Part 5: Effect Sizes & Reporting {.center background-color="#2C3E50"}

---

## Why Effect Sizes Matter

| Study | n | Difference | p-value | Cohen's d |
|-------|---|------------|---------|-----------|
| A | 1000 | 1.5 points | p < .001 | 0.10 |
| B | 30 | 8.0 points | p = .04 | 0.75 |

**P-values tell us IF. Effect sizes tell us HOW BIG.**

---

## Cohen's d

$$d = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}$$

**Cohen's conventions:**

| d | Interpretation |
|---|----------------|
| 0.2 | Small |
| 0.5 | Medium |
| 0.8 | Large |

---

## APA Reporting Format

> A paired samples t-test revealed a significant decrease in anxiety from pre-test (M = 53.20, SD = 10.15) to post-test (M = 46.82, SD = 9.45) in the intervention group, t(39) = 4.23, p < .001, d = 0.89.

**Include:** Descriptives, t, df, p, d
