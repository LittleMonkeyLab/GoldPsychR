## Lab 2 Preview {.center}

**Week 2: Comparing Groups (t-tests)**

---

## Today's Lab Overview

**Duration:** 2 hours

**Dataset:** Experimental Data (n=120)

**What we'll do:**

- Independent samples t-test
- Paired samples t-test
- Effect sizes (Cohen's d)
- Reporting results in APA format

---

## Part 1: Independent Samples t-test

**Time:** 30 minutes

Compare two independent groups:

```r
t.test(score ~ group, data = mydata)
```

**When to use:** Different participants in each condition

---

## Independent t-test: The Code

```r
# Run the test
result <- t.test(score ~ condition, data = experiment)

# View results
result
```

Key output:
- t-statistic
- degrees of freedom
- p-value
- confidence interval

---

## Part 2: Paired Samples t-test

**Time:** 30 minutes

Compare repeated measures:

```r
t.test(pre_score, post_score, paired = TRUE)
```

**When to use:** Same participants measured twice

---

## Paired t-test: The Code

```r
# With two separate columns
t.test(data$pre, data$post, paired = TRUE)

# Or with long format data
t.test(score ~ time, data = long_data, paired = TRUE)
```

---

## Part 3: Effect Sizes

**Time:** 30 minutes

Calculate and interpret Cohen's d:

```r
library(effectsize)
cohens_d(score ~ group, data = mydata)
```

| d value | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| 0.2 | Small |
| 0.5 | Medium |
| 0.8 | Large |

---

## Part 4: APA Reporting

**Time:** 30 minutes

Write up results correctly:

> There was a significant difference between groups, *t*(58) = 2.45, *p* = .017, *d* = 0.64, 95% CI [0.12, 1.16].

Include:
- Test statistic and df
- Exact p-value
- Effect size with CI

---

## Key Takeaways

Today you learned to:

- Run independent samples t-tests
- Run paired samples t-tests
- Calculate and interpret effect sizes
- Report results in APA format
