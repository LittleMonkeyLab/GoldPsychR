# Welcome to Lab 1 {.center background-color="#1a1a2e"}

## The Data Story

Over the next **4 weeks**, we'll work through a complete research workflow:

::: {.incremental}
- **Week 1**: Describe and visualise your data
- **Week 2**: Compare groups with t-tests
- **Week 3**: Compare multiple groups with ANOVA
- **Week 4**: Explore relationships with correlation & regression
:::

::: {.fragment}
We'll use the same dataset throughout, plus **similar datasets** for extra practice.
:::

## Today's Dataset

We've collected **Big Five personality data** from a training study:

- 160 participants completed personality questionnaires
- Half received a training intervention, half were controls
- Measured before (pre) and after (post) the intervention

**Our question**: Did the training affect personality scores?

## Today's Goals

::: {.incremental}
1. Get comfortable with RStudio
2. Load and inspect our data
3. Reverse-score questionnaire items
4. Calculate descriptive statistics
5. Create a simple visualisation
6. Write up results in APA style
:::

## How This Lab Works

We'll work through **5 Parts**, cycling between:

1. **Watch** - Instructor demonstration (these slides)
2. **Try** - WebR practice in your browser
3. **Apply** - Exercise in RStudio

::: {.fragment}
Each cycle reinforces the same skill before moving on!

# Part 1: What is R? {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## What is R?

**R** is a programming language designed for statistics and data analysis.

::: {.incremental}
- **Free** and **open source** - anyone can use it
- Created by statisticians, for statisticians
- Thousands of packages for specialised analyses
- The standard in psychology, biology, and social sciences
- Produces publication-ready figures and tables
:::

## Why R (not SPSS)?

| R | SPSS |
|---|------|
| Free forever | Expensive licence |
| Code is reproducible | Point-and-click is hard to repeat |
| Cutting-edge methods | Lags behind |
| Used in academia & industry | Mainly academia |
| Shareable scripts | Hard to share workflows |

::: {.fragment}
**Learning R is an investment in your future career.**
:::

## RStudio: Your R Workspace

**RStudio** is an application that makes R easier to use.

Think of it like this:

- **R** = the engine
- **RStudio** = the car dashboard

You'll work in RStudio, but R does the actual computing.

## The Four Panes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Top-Left: Source**

- Where you write scripts
- Save your work here

**Bottom-Left: Console**

- Where code runs
- Immediate feedback
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Top-Right: Environment**

- Your data and objects
- Watch it update!

**Bottom-Right: Files/Plots/Help**

- Navigate files

## RStudio in Action

![RStudio IDE with four panes](../labs/images/rstudio.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## WebR: R in Your Browser

Today you'll also use **WebR** - a version of R that runs directly in your web browser.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why WebR?

- No installation needed
- Instant feedback while learning
- Same R code as desktop RStudio
:::

::: {.fragment}
The code cells in this presentation and the WebR Practice chapter are **live** - you can run and edit them!
:::

## Your First Code

Try clicking **Run** on this code cell:

```{webr-r}
1 + 1
```

::: {.fragment}
R returned the answer! The `[1]` just means "first result".
:::

## Creating Variables

We store values using the **assignment operator** `<-`

```{webr-r}
x <- 5
y <- 2
x + y
```

::: {.fragment}
In RStudio, watch the **Environment pane** update when you create variables!
:::

## Vectors: Multiple Values

A **vector** is a collection of values. Create them with `c()`:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
scores
```

## Basic Functions

R has built-in functions for statistics:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
mean(scores)
sd(scores)
length(scores)
```

## Common Error: Object Not Found

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

z + 1
```

```
Error: object 'z' not found
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Create the object first!

```{webr-r}
z <- 10
z + 1
```
:::

# Practice Time! {.center background-color="#27ae60"}

## Part 1: Practice

# Part 2: Loading Data {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## The Personality Dataset

Our study collected data on:

- **160 participants**
- **5 personality items** (p1-p5) on a 1-5 scale
- **Group**: control vs training
- **Time**: pre vs post intervention

Items p4 and p5 are negatively worded (we'll deal with that later!).

## Loading a CSV File

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-annotations: hover

library(readr)
data <- read_csv("personality_lab.csv")
```

1. Load the `readr` package
2. Read the CSV and store as `data`

::: {.callout-warning}
## Working Directory
Make sure your CSV is in the right folder, or use the full file path.
:::

## Let's Load It Live

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
#| autorun: true

# Simulate the personality dataset
set.seed(42)
n <- 160

data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:n,
  group = rep(c("control", "training"), each = n/2),
  time = rep(rep(c("pre", "post"), each = n/4), 2),
  p1 = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15)),
  p2 = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15)),
  p3 = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15)),
  p4 = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.15, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)),
  p5 = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.15, 0.2, 0.35, 0.2, 0.1))
)

# Add training effect
training_post <- data$group == "training" & data$time == "post"
data$p1[training_post] <- pmin(5, data$p1[training_post] + sample(0:1, sum(training_post), replace = TRUE))
data$p2[training_post] <- pmin(5, data$p2[training_post] + sample(0:1, sum(training_post), replace = TRUE))
data$p3[training_post] <- pmin(5, data$p3[training_post] + sample(0:1, sum(training_post), replace = TRUE))
```

```{webr-r}
# View the first 6 rows
head(data)
```

## Inspecting Your Data

```{webr-r}
# Check dimensions: rows x columns
dim(data)
```

```{webr-r}
# See column names
names(data)
```

## Common Error: Function Not Found

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

read_csv("personality_lab.csv")
```

```
Error: could not find function "read_csv"
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Load the package first!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(readr)
read_csv("personality_lab.csv")
```

# Part 3: Reverse Scoring {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Why Reverse Score?

Some questionnaire items are **negatively worded**:

- "I rarely feel anxious" (reversed)
- "I often feel anxious" (normal)

If someone is anxious, they'd score **low** on the first but **high** on the second.

::: {.fragment}
To create a valid total score, we must **reverse** the negatively-worded items.
:::

## The Formula

For a 1-5 Likert scale:

$$\text{reversed} = 6 - \text{original}$$

| Original | Reversed |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 1 |

## Reverse Scoring in R

```{webr-r}
# Reverse-score p4 and p5
data$rev_p4 <- 6 - data$p4
data$rev_p5 <- 6 - data$p5

# Check it worked
head(data[, c("p4", "rev_p4", "p5", "rev_p5")])
```

## Creating the Total Score

```{webr-r}
# Sum all items using REVERSED versions for p4 and p5
data$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +
                   data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5

# View result
head(data[, c("id", "group", "time", "pers_score")])
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Check
Use the **reversed** versions (rev_p4, rev_p5), not the originals!
:::

## Common Error: Wrong Items in Sum

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# WRONG - using unreversed items!
data$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +
                   data$p4 + data$p5
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Always use reversed versions:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# CORRECT
data$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +
                   data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5
```
:::

# Practice Time! {.center background-color="#27ae60"}

## Part 3: Practice

**WebR Practice:**

- Section 3: Reverse Scoring

**RStudio Exercise:**

- Section 2: Reverse Scoring
- Complete Exercise 2.1

::: {.callout-tip}
## What to do

1. Apply the formula: `6 - original`
2. Create reversed items for p4 and p5
3. Sum all items (using reversed versions!)
4. Verify your reversal worked
:::

{{< countdown "15:00" >}}

# Part 4: Analysis {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Overall Descriptives

```{webr-r}
# Calculate overall statistics
mean(data$pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(data$pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)
length(data$pers_score)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Point: na.rm = TRUE

Always include `na.rm = TRUE` to ignore missing values. Without it, a single `NA` makes your result `NA`!
:::

## Grouped Summaries with dplyr

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)

data |>
  group_by(group, time) |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

## Visualisation: Boxplot

```{webr-r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = pers_score, fill = time)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Personality Scores by Group and Time",
    x = "Group",
    y = "Personality Score",
    fill = "Time"
  )
```

## Understanding the Plot

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What to look for:**

- Centre (median line)
- Spread (box height = IQR)
- Outliers (points beyond whiskers)
- Group differences
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Questions to ask:**

- Do groups differ at baseline?
- Is there change over time?
- Which group changed more?
:::
::::

## Common Error: Forgetting na.rm

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

mean(data$pers_score)
```

If any value is `NA`, the result is `NA`!

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Always include `na.rm = TRUE`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

mean(data$pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

# Part 5: APA Write-Up {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Template

> Participants reported moderate levels of [TRAIT] overall (M = ___, SD = ___). At baseline, the control group (M = ___, SD = ___, n = ___) and training group (M = ___, SD = ___, n = ___) were similar. Following the intervention, the control group showed [minimal change / a decrease / an increase] (M = ___, SD = ___), whereas the training group showed [change description] (M = ___, SD = ___).

## Example Write-Up

> Participants reported moderate levels of personality overall (M = 15.42, SD = 2.31). At baseline, the control group (M = 15.10, SD = 2.25, n = 40) and training group (M = 15.33, SD = 2.18, n = 40) were similar. Following the intervention, the control group showed minimal change (M = 15.28, SD = 2.41), whereas the training group showed an increase (M = 16.95, SD = 2.15).
