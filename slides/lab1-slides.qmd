# Welcome to Lab 1 {.center background-color="#1a1a2e"}

## The Data Story

Today we'll work with **Grit Scale data** to learn descriptive statistics:

- Load and inspect data
- Reverse-score questionnaire items
- Calculate subscale scores
- Compare groups with descriptive statistics
- Visualise differences with boxplots
- Write up results in APA style

## Today's Dataset

We've collected **Grit Scale data** from university students:

- 120 students completed the Short Grit Scale (8 items)
- Participants are either First Year or Final Year students
- The scale measures two subscales: Consistency of Interest and Perseverance of Effort

**Our question**: Do grit scores differ between first-year and final-year students?

:::

## How This Lab Works

We'll work through **5 Parts**, cycling between:

1. **Watch** - Instructor demonstration (these slides)
2. **Try** - WebR practice in your browser
3. **Apply** - Exercise in RStudio

::: {.fragment}
Each cycle reinforces the same skill before moving on!

# Part 1: What is R? {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## What is R?

**R** is a programming language designed for statistics and data analysis.

::: {.incremental}
- **Free** and **open source** - anyone can use it
- Created by statisticians, for statisticians
- Thousands of packages for specialised analyses
- The standard in psychology, biology, and social sciences
- Produces publication-ready figures and tables
:::

## Why R (not SPSS)?

| R | SPSS |
|---|------|
| Free forever | Expensive licence |
| Code is reproducible | Point-and-click is hard to repeat |
| Cutting-edge methods | Lags behind |
| Used in academia & industry | Mainly academia |
| Shareable scripts | Hard to share workflows |

::: {.fragment}
**Learning R is an investment in your future career.**
:::

## RStudio: Your R Workspace

**RStudio** is an application that makes R easier to use.

Think of it like this:

- **R** = the engine
- **RStudio** = the car dashboard

You'll work in RStudio, but R does the actual computing.

## The Four Panes

## RStudio in Action

![RStudio IDE with four panes](../labs/images/rstudio.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## WebR: R in Your Browser

Today you'll also use **WebR** - a version of R that runs directly in your web browser.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why WebR?

- No installation needed
- Instant feedback while learning
- Same R code as desktop RStudio
:::

::: {.fragment}
The code cells in this presentation and the WebR Practice chapter are **live** - you can run and edit them!
:::

## Your First Code

Try clicking **Run** on this code cell:

```{webr-r}
1 + 1
```

::: {.fragment}
R returned the answer! The `[1]` just means "first result".
:::

## Creating Variables

We store values using the **assignment operator** `<-`

```{webr-r}
x <- 5
y <- 2
x + y
```

::: {.fragment}
In RStudio, watch the **Environment pane** update when you create variables!
:::

## Vectors: Multiple Values

A **vector** is a collection of values. Create them with `c()`:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
scores
```

## Basic Functions

R has built-in functions for statistics:

```{webr-r}
scores <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 5)
mean(scores)
sd(scores)
length(scores)
```

## Common Error: Object Not Found

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

z + 1
```

```
Error: object 'z' not found
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Create the object first!

```{webr-r}
z <- 10
z + 1
```
:::

# Practice Time! {.center background-color="#27ae60"}

## Part 1: Practice

Open the **WebR Practice** chapter and complete:

- **Section 1: Getting Started with R**
  - Basic Arithmetic
  - Creating Variables
  - Vectors

::: {.callout-tip}
## What to do

# Part 2: Loading Data {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## The Grit Scale Dataset

Our study collected data on:

- **120 university students**
- **8 Grit Scale items** (G1-G8) on a 1-5 scale
- **Study_Year**: First Year (1) or Final Year (2)
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender

Items G1, G3, G5, and G6 are negatively worded (we'll reverse-score them!).

## Loading a CSV File

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-annotations: hover

library(readr)
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

1. Load the `readr` package
2. Read the CSV and store as `data`

::: {.callout-warning}
## Working Directory
Make sure your CSV is in the right folder, or use the full file path.
:::

## Let's Load It Live

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
#| autorun: true

# Load the Grit Scale data from GitHub
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{webr-r}
# View the first 6 rows
head(data)
```

## Inspecting Your Data

```{webr-r}
# Check dimensions: rows x columns
dim(data)
```

```{webr-r}
# See column names
names(data)
```

## Common Error: Function Not Found

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

read_csv("Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv")
```

```
Error: could not find function "read_csv"
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Load the package first!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(readr)
read_csv("Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv")
```

# Part 3: Reverse Scoring {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Why Reverse Score?

The Grit Scale has **negatively worded items**:

- **G1**: "New ideas and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones" (reversed)
- **G2**: "Setbacks don't discourage me" (normal)

If someone is gritty, they'd score **low** on G1 but **high** on G2.

::: {.fragment}
To create valid subscale scores, we must **reverse** items G1, G3, G5, and G6.
:::

## The Formula

For a 1-5 Likert scale:

$$\text{reversed} = 6 - \text{original}$$

| Original | Reversed |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 1 |

## Reverse Scoring in R

```{webr-r}
# Load data first
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reverse-score G1, G3, G5, and G6
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6

# Check it worked
head(data[, c("G1", "rev_G1", "G3", "rev_G3")])
```

## Creating Subscale Scores

The Grit Scale has two subscales:

```{webr-r}
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reverse-score items
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6

# Consistency of Interest (4 items: G1, G3, G5, G6 - all reversed)
data$consistency <- data$rev_G1 + data$rev_G3 + data$rev_G5 + data$rev_G6

# Perseverance of Effort (4 items: G2, G4, G7, G8 - forward scored)
data$perseverance <- data$G2 + data$G4 + data$G7 + data$G8

# View result
head(data[, c("ID", "Study_Year", "consistency", "perseverance")])
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Check
Use the **reversed** versions (rev_G1, rev_G3, rev_G5, rev_G6) for Consistency subscale!
:::

## Common Error: Wrong Items in Sum

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# WRONG - using unreversed items!
data$consistency <- data$G1 + data$G3 + data$G5 + data$G6
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Always use reversed versions:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# CORRECT
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6
data$consistency <- data$rev_G1 + data$rev_G3 + data$rev_G5 + data$rev_G6
```

# Practice Time! {.center background-color="#27ae60"}

## Part 3: Practice

**WebR Practice:**

- Section 3: Reverse Scoring

**RStudio Exercise:**

- Section 3: Reverse Scoring
- Complete Exercise 3.1

::: {.callout-tip}
## What to do

1. Apply the formula: `6 - original`
2. Create reversed items for G1, G3, G5, and G6
3. Create both subscales (Consistency and Perseverance)
4. Verify your reversal worked

# Part 4: Analysis {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Overall Descriptives

```{webr-r}
# Load and prepare data
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reverse-score items
data$rev_G1 <- 6 - data$G1
data$rev_G3 <- 6 - data$G3
data$rev_G5 <- 6 - data$G5
data$rev_G6 <- 6 - data$G6

# Create subscales
data$consistency <- data$rev_G1 + data$rev_G3 + data$rev_G5 + data$rev_G6
data$perseverance <- data$G2 + data$G4 + data$G7 + data$G8

# Calculate overall statistics
mean(data$consistency, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(data$consistency, na.rm = TRUE)
length(data$consistency)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Point: na.rm = TRUE

Always include `na.rm = TRUE` to ignore missing values. Without it, a single `NA` makes your result `NA`!
:::

## Grouped Summaries with dplyr

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)

# Convert Study_Year to factor for grouping
data$Study_Year <- factor(data$Study_Year, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("First Year", "Final Year"))

data |>
  group_by(Study_Year) |>
  summarise(
    M_consistency = mean(consistency, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_consistency = sd(consistency, na.rm = TRUE),
    M_perseverance = mean(perseverance, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_perseverance = sd(perseverance, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

## Visualisation: Boxplot

```{webr-r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5

library(ggplot2)

# Convert Study_Year to factor
data$Study_Year <- factor(data$Study_Year, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("First Year", "Final Year"))

ggplot(data, aes(x = Study_Year, y = consistency, fill = Study_Year)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Consistency of Interest by Study Year",
    x = "Study Year",
    y = "Consistency of Interest Score"
  )
```

## Understanding the Plot

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What to look for:**

- Centre (median line)
- Spread (box height = IQR)
- Outliers (points beyond whiskers)
- Group differences
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Questions to ask:**

- Do first-year and final-year students differ?
- Which group has higher consistency?
- Is the difference meaningful?
:::
::::

## Common Error: Forgetting na.rm

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

mean(data$consistency)
```

If any value is `NA`, the result is `NA`!

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Fix:** Always include `na.rm = TRUE`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

mean(data$consistency, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

# Part 5: APA Write-Up {.center background-color="#2d3436"}

## Template

> Participants reported moderate levels of [SUBSCALE] overall (M = ___, SD = ___). First-year students (M = ___, SD = ___, n = ___) and final-year students (M = ___, SD = ___, n = ___) showed [similar/different] levels of grit. Specifically, first-year students scored [higher/lower] on Consistency of Interest (M = ___, SD = ___) compared to final-year students (M = ___, SD = ___).

## Example Write-Up

> Participants reported moderate levels of grit overall. First-year students (M = 12.45, SD = 2.31, n = 60) and final-year students (M = 13.82, SD = 2.15, n = 60) showed different levels of Consistency of Interest. Specifically, final-year students scored higher on Consistency of Interest (M = 13.82, SD = 2.15) compared to first-year students (M = 12.45, SD = 2.31), suggesting that students may develop greater consistency in their interests as they progress through their degree.
