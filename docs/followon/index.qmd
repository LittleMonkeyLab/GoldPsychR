# What Are Follow-On Exercises?

Follow-on exercises are **transfer learning** opportunities designed to help you consolidate your R skills. Each follow-on:

- Uses a **different dataset** from the main lab
- Covers the **same skills** but with less scaffolding
- Encourages **independent problem-solving**
- Includes **solutions** you can check after attempting

## Why Transfer Practice Matters

Research shows that applying skills to new contexts strengthens learning. By working with different data, you'll:

- Build confidence in your abilities
- Develop transferable skills
- Identify gaps in your understanding
- Prepare for independent research

# Available Follow-Ons

| Lab | Topic | Skills Practised |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| [Lab 1](lab1-followon.qmd) | Wellbeing Study | Reverse scoring, descriptives, boxplots |
| [Lab 2](lab2-followon.qmd) | Sleep & Performance | Data wrangling, filtering, visualisation |
| [Lab 3](lab3-followon.qmd) | Anxiety Treatment | t-tests, effect sizes, interpretation |
| [Lab 4](lab4-followon.qmd) | Study Habits | Correlation, regression, prediction |

# How to Use These Exercises

1. **Complete the main lab first** - Ensure you understand the core material
2. **Attempt independently** - Don't look at solutions until you've tried
3. **Check your work** - Compare your approach to the provided solutions
4. **Reflect** - What was challenging? What did you learn?

## Submission

Follow-on exercises are **optional practice** and do not need to be submitted. However, completing them will significantly boost your confidence and skills.
