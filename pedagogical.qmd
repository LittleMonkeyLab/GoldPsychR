# Overview

This document describes the **pedagogical approach** behind GoldPsychR, designed to lower instructor effort, increase student engagement, and build genuine R fluency through **multiple learning cycles**.

## The Core Insight

Students learn best through **repeated exposure** with **varied contexts**. Rather than showing something once, we expose students to the same concepts through multiple modalities:

1. **Watch** - See code demonstrated with explanation
2. **Try** - Experiment with interactive code in the browser
3. **Apply** - Use the skills on real data in RStudio
4. **Transfer** - Practice again with a different dataset
5. **Reference** - Look up patterns when needed later

## The Innovation: Embedded Slides + WebR Practice

Our key innovation is **embedding mini slide decks directly into practice pages**. Students see:

1. A short slide presentation (5-10 slides) explaining one concept
2. Interactive WebR cells to practice immediately
3. Self-assessment questions to check understanding
4. A download button for the RStudio exercise

**Benefits:**

- Students only need **2 browser tabs** (our page + RStudio Server)
- Slides and practice are **spatially co-located** - no context switching
- Each "Part" is a **complete learning cycle** in ~15 minutes
- Instructors can walk around helping rather than presenting

# The Five-Stage Framework

| Stage | Format | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. **Embedded Demo** | Mini slides in page | Focused demonstration of one concept |
| 2. **WebR Practice** | Interactive code cells | Immediate hands-on experimentation |
| 3. **Self-Assessment** | Quiz questions | Check understanding before moving on |
| 4. **RStudio Exercise** | Downloaded `.qmd` | Apply skills in professional environment |
| 5. **Follow-on Practice** | Transfer exercise | Consolidate with different data |

## Why Multiple Parts Per Lab?

Each lab is divided into **5 Parts**, each covering one coherent skill:

| Lab 1 | Topic |
|-------|-------|
| Part 1 | What is R? Variables & vectors |
| Part 2 | Loading data with `read_csv()` |
| Part 3 | Reverse scoring questionnaire items |
| Part 4 | Descriptive statistics with `dplyr` |
| Part 5 | Visualisation and APA write-up |

**The power of Parts:**

- Each Part is a **complete learning cycle** (watch → try → check → apply)
- Students can work at their own pace
- Struggling students can repeat a Part; advanced students can skip ahead
- Instructors can focus help where it's needed

# The Student Experience

## Two Tabs, Full Workflow

Students open:

1. **GoldPsychR page** - embedded slides + WebR practice
2. **RStudio Server** - for the exercise .qmd

That's it. No juggling multiple windows.

## Self-Paced with Built-in Checkpoints

Each Part includes:

- A **countdown timer** suggesting time allocation
- **Self-assessment questions** that provide immediate feedback
- **Challenge prompts** to extend learning
- A **download button** for the RStudio exercise

## Progressive Scaffolding Removal

- **Part 1**: Full code provided, just run and observe
- **Part 2**: Some blanks to fill in
- **Part 3**: More blanks, hints available
- **Part 4**: Minimal scaffolding
- **Part 5**: Write your own code from scratch

---

# Benefits for Instructors

## Reduced Live Presentation

Instead of presenting for 45 minutes straight:

- Students watch short embedded slides at their own pace
- You circulate and help individuals
- Class time becomes **active learning** time

## Consistent Materials Across Modalities

The same code examples appear in:

- The embedded slides
- The WebR practice cells
- The RStudio exercise template
- The follow-on exercise

One update propagates everywhere.

## Self-Checking Reduces Support Burden

Quiz questions catch common misconceptions:

- "What does `<-` mean?" → answered by quiz
- "Why do I get NA?" → answered by quiz
- "Did I use the reversed items?" → answered by quiz

You focus on **conceptual** help, not syntax questions.

# Technical Implementation

## File Structure

```
chapters/lab1/
├── index.qmd           # Lab overview with links to parts
├── part1.qmd           # Main page: embedded slides + WebR + quiz
├── part1-slides.qmd    # Mini slide deck (rendered as iframe)
├── part2.qmd
├── part2-slides.qmd
└── ...
```

## Embedding Slides

```html
<iframe src="part1-slides.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
```

## WebR Cells with Prompts

```markdown
::: {.callout-tip}
## How to Practice
1. Run the code
2. Edit and experiment
3. Copy to RStudio console
:::
```

## Self-Assessment with webexercises

```r
# Multiple choice
`r mcq(c("wrong", answer = "correct", "wrong"))`

# Fill in the blank
`r fitb("expected_answer")`

# True/False
`r torf(TRUE)`
```

# Scaling to Multiple Labs

The same pattern applies to all 4 labs:

| Lab | Topic | Parts |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Lab 1 | Descriptive Statistics | R basics, loading, scoring, descriptives, visualisation |
| Lab 2 | Comparing Groups | Assumptions, independent t, paired t, effect sizes, reporting |
| Lab 3 | ANOVA | One-way, post-hoc, effect sizes, two-way, interactions |
| Lab 4 | Regression | Correlation, scatterplots, simple regression, multiple regression, diagnostics |

Each lab follows the **same pedagogical structure**, building familiarity and reducing cognitive load.

# Evidence-Based Design

This approach draws on established learning science:

- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Small chunks, worked examples, scaffolding removal
- **Multimedia Learning**: Co-located text and visuals
- **Active Learning**: Practice immediately after instruction
- **Retrieval Practice**: Quiz questions strengthen memory
- **Transfer Learning**: Follow-on exercises with different data
- **Mastery Learning**: Self-paced with checkpoints

---

# Getting Started

1. Direct students to the Lab page
2. Have them open RStudio Server in a second tab
3. Let them work through Parts 1-5 at their own pace
4. Circulate and help individuals
5. Collect completed `.qmd` files as evidence of engagement

**The materials do the heavy lifting. You provide the human support.**
