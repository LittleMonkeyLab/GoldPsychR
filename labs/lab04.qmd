# Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to explore relationships between continuous variables using correlation and regression. We'll build predictive models and check assumptions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Run correlation analyses (Pearson's r)
- Create scatterplots with trend lines
- Build simple linear regression models
- Add multiple predictors
- Interpret R², coefficients, and p-values
- Check model assumptions
- Write APA-style results

# Key Concepts

| Part | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Correlation | `cor.test(x, y)` |
| 2 | Scatterplots | `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` |
| 3 | Simple Regression | `lm(y ~ x)` |
| 4 | Multiple Regression | `lm(y ~ x1 + x2)` |
| 5 | Diagnostics | Assumption checking |
