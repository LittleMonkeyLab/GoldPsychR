title: "Lab 2: Comparing Groups"
subtitle: "Independent & Paired t-tests"
---

# Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to compare two groups using t-tests. We'll test whether there are significant differences between conditions and calculate effect sizes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Run independent samples t-tests
- Run paired samples t-tests
- Calculate and interpret Cohen's d
- Create comparison visualisations
- Write APA-style results

# Key Concepts

| Part | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Independent t-test | `t.test(score ~ group)` |
| 2 | Paired t-test | `t.test(pre, post, paired = TRUE)` |
| 3 | Effect Size | Cohen's d calculation |
| 4 | Visualisation | Boxplots by group |
| 5 | APA Reporting | t, df, p, d |
