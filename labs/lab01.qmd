title: "Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics"
subtitle: "Personality & The Big Five"
---

# Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to analyse Big Five personality data in R. We'll work through loading data, scoring questionnaires, calculating descriptives, creating visualisations, and writing up results.

## The Data Story

We've collected personality data from a training study:

- **160 participants** completed personality questionnaires
- Half received a **training intervention**, half were **controls**
- Measured **before** (pre) and **after** (post) the intervention

**Our research question**: Did the training affect personality scores?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Navigate RStudio and understand its four panes
- Load CSV data into R using `read_csv()`
- Reverse-score negatively worded questionnaire items
- Calculate descriptive statistics by group using `dplyr`
- Create boxplots using `ggplot2`
- Write an APA-style results paragraph

# Key Concepts

## The Five Parts

| Part | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | RStudio Tour | Variables, vectors, functions |
| 2 | Loading Data | `read_csv()`, `head()`, `str()` |
| 3 | Reverse Scoring | Formula: `6 - original` |
| 4 | Descriptives & Plots | `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `ggplot()` |
| 5 | APA Write-Up | Reporting M, SD, n |

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Object not found | Variable doesn't exist | Create it first |
| Function not found | Package not loaded | Use `library()` |
| Result is NA | Missing values | Add `na.rm = TRUE` |
| Wrong total score | Used unreversed items | Use `rev_` versions |
