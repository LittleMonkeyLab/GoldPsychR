|:----:|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Descriptive Statistics | [Lab Overview](lab01.qmd) |
| 2 | Comparing Groups (t-tests) | [Lab Overview](lab02.qmd) |
| 3 | ANOVA | [Lab Overview](lab03.qmd) |
| 4 | Correlation & Regression | [Lab Overview](lab04.qmd) |

# Learning Pathway

For each lab, follow this sequence:

1. **Slides** - Watch the instructor demo (opens in new tab)
2. **WebR Practice** - Try it yourself in the browser
3. **Exercise** - Apply skills in RStudio and submit
4. **Follow-On** - Extra practice with different data

## Tip: Multi-Tab Workflow

For the best experience, open three browser tabs:

1. Slides (for following the demo)
2. WebR Practice (for trying code)
3. RStudio Server (for the exercise)
