# Learning Pathway

For each lab, follow this sequence:

2. ![](/assets/images/svg/play.svg){width=20} **WebR Practice** - Try it yourself in the browser
3. ![](/assets/images/svg/laptop.svg){width=20} **Exercise** - Apply skills in RStudio and submit

## Tip: Multi-Tab Workflow

For the best experience, open three browser tabs:

1. Slides (for following the demo)
2. WebR Practice (for trying code)
3. RStudio Server (for the exercise)
