# Overview

In this lab, you'll learn to compare three or more groups using ANOVA. We'll run one-way and two-way analyses, conduct post-hoc tests, and calculate effect sizes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Run one-way ANOVA
- Conduct Tukey's HSD post-hoc comparisons
- Calculate and interpret eta-squared
- Run two-way (factorial) ANOVA
- Interpret interaction effects
- Write APA-style results

# Key Concepts

| Part | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | One-Way ANOVA | `aov(score ~ condition)` |
| 2 | Post-Hoc Tests | `TukeyHSD(model)` |
| 3 | Effect Size | Eta-squared (η²) |
| 4 | Two-Way ANOVA | `aov(score ~ A * B)` |
| 5 | Interactions | Interaction plots |
