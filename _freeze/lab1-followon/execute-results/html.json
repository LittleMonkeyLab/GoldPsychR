You'll apply the same techniques to new data with less scaffolding.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Dataset: Wellbeing Study\n\nResearchers investigated the effect of a mindfulness intervention on psychological wellbeing. Participants completed a 6-item wellbeing questionnaire before and after an 8-week programme.\n\n- **Participants**: 120 university students\n- **Design**: 2 (group: control vs mindfulness) × 2 (time: pre vs post)\n- **Measures**: 6 wellbeing items (w1–w6) on a 1–7 scale\n- **Reverse-scored items**: w3 and w5\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Task 1: Load and Inspect\n\nLoad the wellbeing dataset and explore its structure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data\nwellbeing <- read_csv(\"wellbeing_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE: View the first few rows\n\n\n# YOUR CODE: Check the structure\n\n\n# YOUR CODE: Check dimensions\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Questions\n\n1.
