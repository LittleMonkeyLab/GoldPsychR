Time and attention are limited.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nA five-component workflow where each element reinforces the same worked examples and builds cumulative R fluency:\n\n| Stage | Format | Purpose |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| 1. **Instructor Demo** | Revealjs slides | Live demonstration of key \"moves\"; errors fixed in real time |\n| 2. **WebR Practice** | Browser-based chapter | Independent practice with self-assessment; instant feedback flags gaps |\n| 3. **Scaffolded Template** | Local `.qmd` in RStudio | Consolidation and submission; students render clean output |\n| 4. **Follow-on Exercise** | Optional practice `.qmd` | Transfer learning with a fresh dataset |\n| 5. **R Handbook** | Reference documentation | Persistent resource organised by skill (Basics, Wrangling, Visualisation, etc.) |\n\n**The Outcome**\n\n- Consistent learning arc across modalities\n- Reduced duplication for instructors\n- Cumulative confidence-building for students\n- Durable reference materials that support future coursework\n\n---\n\n# Stage 1: Instructor Demo on Slides\n\n## File: `lab1-slides.qmd`\n\nQuarto revealjs presentation. Structure mirrors the **same 7 \"moves\"** as the other stages.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Code annotations** on every code block explain what each line does.\n- **Live execution** – you run code and show output (and occasional errors).\n- **Scaffolding** – early slides have all code; later slides blank out one or two lines so you live-code with students watching.\n- **Speaker notes** highlight common misconceptions you'll encounter.\n\n### Slide Outline\n\n#### Section 1: Orientation (Slides 1–3)\n\n**Move 1: RStudio Tour**\n\n```r\n# Slide content (annotated)\n1 + 1  # <1>\nx <- 5  # <2>\nx  # <3>\n```\n\n1. Quick arithmetic to show Console pane.\n2. Assignment operator – value lives in Environment.\n3. Typing the name recalls the value.\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"Watch the Environment pane update when I press Enter.\"*\n\n#### Section 2: Basic Operations (Slides 4–6)\n\n**Move 2: Variables & Vectors**\n\n```r\nx <- 5  # <1>\ny <- 2  # <1>\nx + y  # <2>\n\nz <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # <3>\nmean(z)  # <4>\n```\n\n1. Create two scalar variables.\n2. Perform arithmetic.\n3. The `c()` function combines values into a vector.\n4. Calculate the mean of the vector.\n\n**Deliberate error demonstration** (on slide, with fix):\n\n```r\n# MISTAKE: Forgetting the assignment operator\nx <- 5\nx + 3\n# Output: 8 ✓\n\n# MISTAKE: Trying to add to an unassigned variable\ny + 1\n# Error: object 'y' not found ✗\n\n# FIX: Assign first\ny <- 2\ny + 1\n# Output: 3 ✓\n```\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"Notice the red error in the console. R is telling you the name doesn't exist. This is one of the top errors you'll make early on—don't panic, it just means you haven't run the line that creates* `y` *yet.\"*\n\n#### Section 3: Data Loading (Slides 7–8)\n\n**Move 3: Load and Inspect**\n\n```r\n# Two common ways\ndata <- read.csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")  # <1>\n# OR\nlibrary(readr)  # <2>\ndata <- read_csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")  # <3>\n\nhead(data)  # <4>\nstr(data)  # <5>\n```\n\n1. Base R function; returns a data frame.\n2. Load the readr package for tidyverse compatibility.\n3. readr's version; often faster and tidier.\n4. Display first 6 rows.\n5. Display structure: column names and types.\n\n**Deliberate error:**\n\n```r\n# MISTAKE: Forgetting library()\nread_csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")\n# Error: could not find function \"read_csv\" ✗\n\n# FIX:\nlibrary(readr)\nread_csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")  # ✓\n```\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"If you type a function and R says 'could not find function', 99% of the time you haven't loaded its package yet. Use* `library(packagename)` *first.\"*\n\n#### Section 4: Reverse Scoring (Slides 9–10)\n\n**Move 4: Reverse-Score Items**\n\nShow logic once, then apply:\n\n```r\n# Logic: For a 5-point scale, reverse = 6 - raw\ndata$rev_p4 <- 6 - data$p4  # <1>\ndata$rev_p5 <- 6 - data$p5  # <1>\n\n# Create total score\ndata$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +  # <2>\n                   data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5\n\nsummary(data$pers_score)  # <3>\n```\n\n1. Reverse-score each item; store as new column.\n2. Sum the original and reversed items into a total.\n3. Check the result.\n\n**Deliberate error and conceptual trap:**\n\n```r\n# MISTAKE: Using raw (unreversed) item in the sum\ndata$pers_score_WRONG <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +\n                          data$p4 + data$p5  # ✗ p4 not reversed!\n\n# CORRECT:\ndata$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +\n                   data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5  # ✓\n\n# Check visually:\nhead(data[, c(\"p4\", \"rev_p4\", \"pers_score\")])\n# You should see p4 and rev_p4 as mirror opposites\n```\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"This is a real-world mistake! You reverse the items, but then forget to use the reversed versions in your sum. Always check: did I use* `rev_p4` *or* `p4`? *\"*\n\n#### Section 5: Descriptives by Group (Slides 11–12)\n\n**Move 5: Compute Summary Statistics**\n\n```r\n# Overall descriptives\nmean(data$pers_score)  # <1>\nsd(data$pers_score)\nlength(data$pers_score)\n\n# By between-subject factor (group)\naggregate(pers_score ~ group, data = data,  # <2>\n          FUN = mean)\n\n# By both group and time (within + between)\nlibrary(dplyr)  # <3>\ndata_summary <- data |>  # <4>\n  group_by(group, time) |>  # <5>\n  summarise(  # <6>\n    mean = mean(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd   = sd(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n    = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\ndata_summary  # <7>\n```\n\n1. Single summary statistics (scalar).\n2. Stratify by one factor; use `aggregate()` (base R).\n3. Load dplyr for cleaner syntax.\n4. Pipe operator: pass data forward.\n5. Group by two factors.\n6. Compute mean, SD, and count per group.\n7. Display the summary table.\n\n**Deliberate error (common in early attempts):**\n\n```r\n# MISTAKE: Forgetting na.rm = TRUE when there are missing values\ndata_summary <- data |>\n  group_by(group, time) |>\n  summarise(\n    mean = mean(pers_score),  # ✗ If any NA, result is NA!\n    sd   = sd(pers_score)\n  )\n\n# FIX:\ndata_summary <- data |>\n  group_by(group, time) |>\n  summarise(\n    mean = mean(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE),  # ✓\n    sd   = sd(pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n```\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"This is a silent killer. If one participant has a missing value, the mean becomes NA. You won't get an error—R just gives you NA. Always add* `na.rm = TRUE` *to be safe.\"*\n\n#### Section 6: Boxplots (Slide 13)\n\n**Move 6: Visualise the Distributions**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # <1>\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = pers_score, fill = time)) +  # <2>\n  geom_boxplot() +  # <3>\n  theme_minimal() +  # <4>\n  labs(title = \"Personality Score by Group and Time\",  # <5>\n       y = \"Personality Score\",\n       x = \"Group\")\n```\n\n1. Load ggplot2.\n2. Map variables: x-axis = group, y-axis = score, fill colour = time.\n3. Boxplot geom.\n4. Clean theme.\n5. Meaningful labels.\n\n**Deliberate error (missing aesthetic):**\n\n```r\n# MISTAKE: Forgetting the fill aesthetic; lose the time factor\nggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = pers_score)) +\n  geom_boxplot()  # ✗ No time separation\n\n# FIX:\nggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = pers_score, fill = time)) +\n  geom_boxplot()  # ✓\n```\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"Notice the plot went from single boxes to overlapping boxes once we added the* `fill = time` *aesthetic. That's how ggplot knows to split each group box by time.\"*\n\n#### Section 7: APA Write-Up (Slide 14)\n\n**Move 7: Report Descriptives**\n\nTemplate with blanks:\n\nParticipants reported moderate levels of personality [TRAIT] overall\n(M = ___, SD = ___). At baseline, the control group scored M = ___, \nSD = ___ (n = ___), and the training group scored M = ___, SD = ___ \n(n = ___). Following the intervention, the control group showed little \nchange (M = ___, SD = ___), whereas the training group showed an increase \n(M = ___, SD = ___). These descriptive patterns suggest a potential \ntraining-related effect that will be formally tested using an \nindependent-samples t-test in Part 2.\n\n**Speaker note:** *\"Copy the numbers from your* `data_summary` *table. Always include M, SD, and n. This paragraph sets up the question: do we see a real difference, or just noise?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Code Annotations: What & Why\n\nEvery code block uses **Quarto's code annotation feature** (lines marked with `# <1>`, `# <2>`, etc.) paired with a numbered explanation list.\n\n**Why annotations?**\n\n- Students read code *and* explanation simultaneously.\n- Annotations draw attention to the **purpose** of each line (not just syntax).\n- Especially powerful for showing how dplyr pipes chain: each annotation is one logical step.\n\n---\n\n## Speaker Notes & Common Errors\n\nInclude a speaker-notes section in the revealjs YAML:\n\n```yaml\n---\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    slide-number: true\n    incremental: true\n    code-fold: false\n---\n```\n\nThen use `^` in slide content to add speaker notes:\n\n```markdown\n## Move 2: Variables\n\n[code block here]\n\n^\nThis is a speaker note: Emphasize that <- is **not** equals. \nIt means \"assign this value to this name.\" Watch for students \ntyping = instead of <-.\n```\n\n**Common errors to spotlight:**\n\n1. **`=` vs `<-`**: \"People confuse assignment with equals. In R, use `<-` or `=` (in most contexts), but `<-` is standard.\"\n2. **Missing `library()` calls**: \"If you see 'could not find function', load its package first.\"\n3. **Forgetting `$` or `[[]]` to access columns**: \"Is it a data frame or a vector? If data frame, use `data$colname`.\"\n4. **`na.rm = TRUE` forgotten**: \"Silent killer: missing values become NA in the result. Always add this.\"\n5. **Reversed items not used in sum**: \"You reversed the items, but did you actually use them in the score?\"\n\n---\n\n# Stage 2: Self-Directed WebR Chapter\n\n## File: `lab1-webr.qmd`\n\nQuarto HTML document with **embedded WebR code cells** and **webexercises quizzes** for self-assessment.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Same worked example** as the slides: personality_lab.csv, 7 moves.\n- **Executable code cells** (students click \"Run Code\").\n- **Progressive complexity**: early cells fully completed; later cells have blanks to fill in.\n- **Concept checks**: webexercises questions (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank) appear after each move.\n- **No scoring pressure**: solutions shown immediately (not graded).\n\n### YAML Header for WebR + webexercises\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1 WebR Chapter: Descriptive Statistics\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    include-in-header: webexercises.html\nfilters:\n  - webr\n---\n```\n\nYou must include webexercises CSS/JS. See the search result above for setup details.\n\n### Content Structure\n\n#### Section 1: Load & Inspect\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n> Your first task is to load the dataset. We'll use `readr::read_csv()`, which integrates well with ggplot and dplyr. After loading, always inspect: what are the column names? What are the data types?\n\n**Runnable WebR cell (read-only):**\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| read-only: true\nlibrary(readr)\ndata <- read_csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")\nhead(data)\n```\n\n**Explanation continues:**\n\n> Observe the output. We have columns: ID, group, time, and five personality items (p1–p5). Good data!\n\n**Concept Check (webexercises):**\n\n<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>read_csv() is from base R</option><option value='answer'>read_csv() is from the readr package</option><option value=''>read_csv() is from ggplot2</option><option value=''>read_csv() is from dplyr</option></select>\n\nRendered as: **Which package provides `read_csv()`?**\n- read_csv() is from base R\n- ✅ read_csv() is from the readr package\n- read_csv() is from ggplot2\n- read_csv() is from dplyr\n\n#### Section 2: Reverse Scoring\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n> Items p4 and p5 are reverse-keyed. On a 1–5 scale, we reverse using the formula `6 - raw_item`. Let's code it:\n\n**Editable WebR cell (with blanks):**\n\n```{webr-r}\n# Reverse-score items p4 and p5\ndata$rev_p4 <- 6 - data$___  # <1>\ndata$rev_p5 <- 6 - data$___  # <1>\n\n# Create total score\ndata$pers_score <- data$p1 + data$p2 + data$p3 +\n                   data$rev_p4 + data$rev_p5\n\n# Check: did reverse-scoring work?\nhead(data[, c(\"p4\", \"rev_p4\", \"pers_score\")])\n```\n\n1. Fill in the column name (p4 or p5) to complete the reverse formula.\n\n**Concept check:**\n\n<input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"6\"]'/>\n\nRendered as: **On a 1–5 Likert scale, the reverse-scoring formula is: 6 - item. Fill in the number:**\n- Answer: 6\n\n#### Section 3: Descriptives by Group\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n> Now we compute mean, SD, and n for each group-time combination. We'll use dplyr's grouped summarise. Watch the annotation numbers—each one is a logical step:\n\n**Editable WebR cell:**\n\n```{webr-r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata_summary <- data |>  # <1>\n  group_by(group, ___) |>  # <2>\n  summarise(  # <3>\n    mean = mean(pers_score, na.rm = ___),  # <4>\n    sd   = sd(pers_score, na.rm = ___),  # <4>\n    n    = n()  # <5>\n  )\n\ndata_summary\n```\n\n1. Start with the data object.\n2. Group by group and _____ (fill in the other factor).\n3. For each group, compute summaries.\n4. Mean and SD of pers_score; always use `na.rm = TRUE` to handle missing values.\n5. Count the number of observations per group.\n\n**Concept checks:**\n\n<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>time</option><option value='answer'>time</option><option value=''>error</option><option value=''>ID</option></select>\n\nRendered as: **What is the other grouping factor (besides group)?**\n- time\n- time ✅\n- error\n- ID\n\n<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\nRendered as: **True or False: `na.rm = TRUE` removes rows with missing values.**\n- ✅ **True**\n- **False**\n\n*(Speaker note to yourself: The answer is True; `na.rm` tells R to ignore NA when computing the mean.)*\n\n#### Section 4: Boxplots\n\n**Full WebR cell (students run as-is, then modify):**\n\n```{webr-r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = pers_score, fill = time)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Personality Score by Group and Time\",\n       y = \"Personality Score (sum of items)\",\n       x = \"Group\")\n```\n\n**Challenge (WebR comment, not graded):**\n\n> Modify the plot: try changing `fill = time` to `colour = time`. What changes? Run the code and observe.\n\n#### Section 5: APA Write-Up\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n> Use your `data_summary` table to fill in the template below. Copy the numbers from the output above.\n\n**Text prompt (webexercises):**\n\nWrite 3–4 sentences describing your descriptive statistics. \nInclude group, time, means, standard deviations, and sample sizes.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Example Answer</button>\n\nParticipants reported moderate levels of personality overall \n(M = 3.27, SD = 0.70). At baseline, the control group (M = 3.19, SD = 0.70, n = 40) \nand training group (M = 3.23, SD = 0.66, n = 40) were similar. After the intervention, \nthe control group showed minimal change (M = 3.20, SD = 0.72), whereas the training group \nshowed an increase (M = 3.58, SD = 0.60). These descriptives suggest a possible \ntraining effect that will be tested formally in Part 2.\n\n</div>\n\n\n---\n\n### Why WebR?\n\n- **No installation required**: runs in browser; students see results immediately.\n- **Self-paced**: students can linger on a cell, experiment, break it intentionally.\n- **Isolation**: changes in one cell don't cascade to others (each cell is sandboxed, though persistent within a session).\n\n---\n\n# Stage 3: Scaffolded `.qmd` Template for Local RStudio\n\n## File: `lab1-descriptives.qmd`\n\nA starter Quarto document students open in RStudio, edit, and render locally.\n\n### YAML Header\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics & Data Exploration\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"13 January 2026\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: false\n    code-annotations: below\n    theme: cosmo\n---\n```\n\n### Content & Scaffolding Strategy\n\n#### Section 1: Load Data\n\n```markdown\n## 1. Load Packages & Data\n\nLoad the packages you'll need and read in the data.\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n```r\n# TODO: Load personality_lab.csv and assign it to 'data'\ndata <- read_csv(\"personality_lab.csv\")\n\n# Check the structure\nhead(data)\nstr(data)\n```\n\n1. For reading CSV files.\n2. For data manipulation (group_by, summarise).\n3. For plotting.\n\n**Scaffold level:** Fully completed. Students just see what to load.\n\n---\n\n#### Section 2: Reverse Scoring\n\n```markdown\n## 2. Create Reverse-Scored Items & Scale Score\n\nItems p4 and p5 are reverse-keyed. Reverse them using the formula \n`6 - item`, then create a total personality score.\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell code-annotations='below'}\n\n:::\n\n\n1. Apply the reverse-scoring formula to each item.\n2. Sum all items (using the reversed versions for p4 & p5).\n3. Display a few rows to verify the reversal.\n\n**Scaffold level:** Fully completed. Annotation explains every step.\n\n---\n\n#### Section 3: Descriptive Statistics\n\n```markdown\n## 3. Compute Descriptive Statistics\n\nCompute mean, standard deviation, and sample size for the personality score, \noverall and by group and time.\n```\n\n### 3a. Overall descriptives\n\n```r\n# Overall summary\nmean_overall <- mean(data$pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)  # <1>\nsd_overall <- sd(data$pers_score, na.rm = TRUE)  # <1>\nn_overall <- length(data$pers_score)  # <2>\n\ncat(\"Overall M =\", round(mean_overall, 2),\n    \", SD =\", round(sd_overall, 2),\n    \", n =\", n_overall, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n1.

Pipe the data forward.\n2. Group by both factors.\n3. For each group combination, compute summaries.\n4. Mean and standard deviation.\n5. Sample size per group.\n6. Ungroup the result (optional but tidy).\n\n**Scaffold level:** Fully completed, but students see the full dplyr pipeline annotated line-by-line.\n\n---\n\n#### Section 4: Visualisations\n\n```markdown\n## 4. Create Visualisations\n```\n\n### 4a. Boxplot: Score by Group and Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n1. Map variables to aesthetics: group on x, score on y, time as fill colour.\n2.

Boxplot: Score by Time (collapsed across groups)\n\nCreate a boxplot showing the effect of time, collapsing across group:\n\n```r\n# TODO: Create a boxplot with time on the x-axis and pers_score on the y-axis.\n# Hint: use geom_boxplot() and set the aesthetic aes(x = time, y = pers_score).\n\n# Your code here:\n\n```\n\n**Scaffold level:** Partially completed (blank). Students fill in the code.\n\n---\n\n#### Section 5: APA Write-Up\n\n## 5. Write-Up: Descriptive Statistics\n\nWrite a short paragraph (3–4 sentences) describing your results in APA style.\n\nInclude:\n- Overall mean and SD\n- Means and SDs by group (at baseline)\n- Means and SDs by time (collapsed across group or by group)\n- A brief interpretation (e.g., \"The training group showed higher scores than control at post-intervention\")\n\n### Your write-up:\n\n[Type your paragraph here]\n\n### Example (for reference):\n\nParticipants reported moderate levels of personality overall (M = 3.27, SD = 0.70).\nAt baseline, the control group (M = 3.19, SD = 0.70, n = 40) and training group \n(M = 3.23, SD = 0.66, n = 40) were similar. After the intervention, the control group \nshowed minimal change (M = 3.20, SD = 0.72), whereas the training group showed an \nincrease (M = 3.58, SD = 0.60). These results suggest a potential training effect \nthat will be formally tested in Part 2.\n\n\n**Scaffold level:** Explanation and example; students write their own.\n\n---\n\n#### Section 6: Reflection (Optional)\n\n## 6. Reflection & Next Steps\n\nAnswer these briefly:\n\n1. **What do the descriptive statistics tell us about the training effect?**\n   [Type your answer]\n\n2. **What would a paired t-test tell us that the descriptives don't?**\n   [Type your answer]\n\n3. **What questions do you still have?**\n   [Type your answer]\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps: Part 2\n\nIn the next lab, we will use **t-tests** to formally test whether:\n- The training group improved more than the control group (interaction test)\n- There was a main effect of time (paired t-test)\n- Groups differed overall (independent t-test)\n\nYou already have clean, scored data and descriptives. We'll build directly on this!\n\n\n---\n\n### How Students Use This\n\n1. **Download the template** from the course website.\n2. **Open in RStudio** (`File > Open File`).\n3. **Work through each section**, running code cells and filling in blanks.\n4. **Render the document** (`Ctrl+Shift+K` or click \"Render\").\n5. **Save the HTML output** as evidence of completion.\n\n**Instructor tip:** Tell students to render early, render often. If a code cell breaks, they'll see the error immediately.\n\n---\n\n# Stage 4: Self-Assessment & Revision (Integrated into WebR Chapter & Quiz)\n\n## Embedded Quizzes Using `webexercises`\n\nAfter each \"move\" in the WebR chapter, students encounter a short self-assessment quiz.\n\n### Example: Multi-Choice Quiz (After Move 3: Load & Inspect)\n\n### Quick Check: Data Loading\n\n<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>read_csv() always returns a tibble, whereas read.csv() returns a data frame</option><option value='answer'>read_csv() is from the readr package; read.csv() is from base R</option><option value=''>They are exactly the same function</option><option value=''>read_csv() is slower than read.csv()</option></select>\n\n**Rendered output:**\n\n> **Which is true about read_csv() vs read.csv()?**\n> - read_csv() always returns a tibble, whereas read.csv() returns a data frame\n> - ✅ read_csv() is from the readr package; read.csv() is from base R\n> - They are exactly the same function\n> - read_csv() is slower than read.csv()\n\nWhen a student clicks an answer, webexercises highlights the correct one (green) and any incorrect choice (red). Solutions appear immediately—no scoring, no judgment, just feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Fill-in-the-Blank (After Move 2: Reverse Scoring)\n\n### Quick Check: Reverse Scoring Formula\n\nOn a 1–5 Likert scale, the reverse-scoring formula is: ___ - item\n\n<input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"6\"]'/>\n\n**Rendered output:**\n\n> On a 1–5 Likert scale, the reverse-scoring formula is: [input box] - item\n> \n> **Answer:** 6\n\n---\n\n### Example: True/False (After Move 4: Descriptives)\n\n### Quick Check: Missing Values\n\n**True or False:** If you forget `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean \nof a vector with missing (NA) values, R will silently compute the mean \nof the remaining values.\n\n<select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\n**Rendered output:**\n\n> **True or False:** If you forget `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean \n> of a vector with missing (NA) values, R will silently compute the mean \n> of the remaining values.\n>\n> - True\n> - ✅ **False** (Correct! The result will be NA unless you set na.rm = TRUE.)\n\n---\n\n## Grade Feedback\n\nwebexercises includes a progress counter across the entire page:\n\n**Progress:** You have answered X out of Y questions correctly.\n\nThis updates in real time as students click answers. It's **not graded**—just motivational. The purpose is to flag misunderstandings so they can re-read the relevant section or ask for help.\n\n---\n\n# How Instructors Implement This Workflow\n\n## Weekly Schedule (2-hour lab)\n\n### Week N Lab (180 minutes)\n\n**Phase 1: Instructor Demo (45 minutes)**\n\n1. Open `lab1-slides.qmd` on the projector.\n2. Work through \"Moves 1–4\" live, narrating each step.\n3. Make deliberate errors and fix them (show it's normal).\n4. Ask students to predict what the code will do before you run it.\n5. Pause frequently: *\"What should happen next?\"*\n\n**What students do:** Watch, take notes, ask questions. Optionally, open a blank R script and copy your moves in real time (no pressure).\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: Independent WebR Practice (60 minutes)**\n\n1. Share the link to `lab1-webr.qmd` on the course website.\n2. Students work through at their own pace in browsers (no software installation).\n3. You circulate: spot students struggling, point them to the annotation, help them interpret quiz feedback.\n4. By the end, students should have completed all 5 moves and seen all quiz feedback.\n\n**What students do:** Read explanations, run or edit WebR cells, answer quizzes. Backspace and retry. No judgment.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 3: Scaffolded `.qmd` in RStudio (60 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students how to download `lab1-descriptives.qmd` and open it in RStudio.\n2. Demonstrate rendering: `Ctrl+Shift+K` → HTML output appears.\n3. Walk through Section 1 live: load the data, run the code, see the output.\n4. Students work on Sections 2–5 independently, asking you or peers for help.\n5. Tell them: *\"If a code cell has an error, read the error message carefully. Usually it tells you what's wrong.\"*\n\n**What students do:** Edit code, fill in blanks, run cells, interpret output, write the APA paragraph, render the final HTML. This is their \"proof of completion.\"\n\n---\n\n**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Collectively review one student's APA paragraph on screen (with permission). Discuss: *\"What story do the descriptives tell?\"*\n2. Remind them: *\"Next week, we use t-tests to test this story formally.\"*\n3. Collect the `.qmd` or rendered HTML as attendance / completion check.\n\n---\n\n## Instructor Time Savings\n\n- **Minimal prep repetition:** You write the content once (annotations + explanations + quizzes), then reuse across slides, WebR, and template.\n- **Auto-grading:** quizzes auto-check; you just scan for common mistakes.\n- **Scalable help:** WebR chapter and quizzes answer 80% of beginner questions (\"What does `<-` mean?\" → \"See the annotation,\" or \"What's the reverse formula?\" → \"Try the quiz\").\n- **Student confidence:** Students render a clean HTML output. They've \"published\" something. Wins engagement.\n\n---\n\n# Selling This to Colleagues\n\n## Key Talking Points\n\n### 1. **It's a Single Worked Example, Reused Three Ways**\n\n> \"We don't create three separate lessons. We design ONE coherent worked example (personality data, 7 moves), then present it across three modalities. This consistency helps students recognise patterns.\"\n\n### 2. **Code Annotations Are Powerful**\n\n> \"Every code cell explains *what* it does and *why*. Students aren't guessing. Annotations scale: you write them once, they're embedded in slides, WebR, and the template.\"\n\n### 3. **Deliberate Error Demonstration Normalises Mistakes**\n\n> \"We show common errors live, then fix them. This is honest: coding is messy. Students see that errors are information, not shame. It lowers anxiety.\"\n\n### 4. **WebR Removes a Barrier**\n\n> \"No installation, no environment setup, no 'but it doesn't work on my laptop.' Students see results instantly in a browser. They can experiment safely.\"\n\n### 5. **Self-Assessment Quizzes Reduce Your Support Burden**\n\n> \"Quizzes flag misconceptions automatically. Instead of the instructor answering 'What's reverse scoring?' 20 times, students read the explanation and take a quiz. You focus on conceptual teaching.\"\n\n### 6. **The Scaffolded `.qmd` Bridges Theory & Practice**\n\n> \"The WebR chapter is safe practice. The `.qmd` is applied practice in their own environment. By rendering a clean HTML document, they own their learning.\"\n\n### 7. **Easy to Iterate**\n\n> \"Next year, you tweak one annotation, one quiz, one template. You don't rewrite three lessons. And you have student-generated HTML outputs to review—real data on what clicked.\"\n\n### 8. **Extends Elegantly to Part 2**\n\n> \"Part 2 (t-tests) uses the *same data and template*. Sections 1–5 are copy-pasted. You only add Sections 6–7 (new statistical tests). Students see continuity.\"\n\n---\n\n# Technical Setup for Colleagues\n\n## Required files in your course directory\n\n```\ncourse-website/\n├── _quarto.yml\n├── slides/\n│   └── lab1-slides.qmd\n├── chapters/\n│   └── lab1-webr.qmd\n├── templates/\n│   └── lab1-descriptives.qmd\n├── data/\n│   └── personality_lab.csv\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## `.qmd` Requirements\n\n**For slides (`lab1-slides.qmd`):**\n\n```yaml\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    slide-number: true\n    code-line-numbers: false\n    code-annotations: hover\n```\n\n**For WebR chapter (`lab1-webr.qmd`):**\n\n```yaml\nfilters:\n  - webr\ninclude-in-header:\n  - text: |\n      <script src=\"https://debruine.github.io/webexercises/webexercises.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://debruine.github.io/webexercises/style.css\" />\n```\n\n**For template (`.qmd`):**\n\n```yaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-annotations: below\n    code-fold: false\n```\n\n---\n\n## Minimal Example: Three-File Workflow\n\n### File 1: `lab1-slides.qmd` (Excerpt)\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics\"\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    code-annotations: hover\n---\n```\n\n```r\n# Move 1: RStudio Tour\n\n1 + 1  # <1>\n```\n\n1.

You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\n### Longer MCQs (`longmcq()`)\n\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use `longmcq()` to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It's probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with `echo=FALSE`. \n\n**What is a p-value?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_IFISQQJZYI'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_IFISQQJZYI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability that the null hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_IFISQQJZYI\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_IFISQQJZYI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability of making an error in your conclusion</span></label></div>\n\n\n**What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_KZPKTOUAYB'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_KZPKTOUAYB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_KZPKTOUAYB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>95% of the data fall within this range</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_KZPKTOUAYB\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean</span></label></div>\n\n\n## Checked sections\n\nCreate sections with the class `webex-check` to add a button that hides feedback until it is pressed.
