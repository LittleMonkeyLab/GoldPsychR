Subject: Lab 1 Resources - Grit Scale Descriptive Statistics

Hi Stacey, Maria, and Pete,

I've prepared all the materials for Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics (Grit Scale). Here's everything you need to know about the resources and how to use them.

WHAT WE'RE TEACHING
===================

Topic: Descriptive Statistics using the Short Grit Scale (8 items)
Dataset: 120 university students (First Year vs Final Year)
Skills: Loading data, reverse-scoring, calculating subscales, descriptive stats, boxplots, APA write-up

THE 3-STEP WORKFLOW (EVERY PART)
================================

Each of the 5 parts follows the same structure:

1. WATCH - You demonstrate using embedded slides
2. TRY - Students practice with interactive code in their browser (WebR)
3. DO - Students complete exercises in their downloaded notebook (RStudio Server)

IMPORTANT: Students download ONE notebook in Part 1, then use it for all 5 parts.

RESOURCE STRUCTURE
==================

Main Entry Point
----------------
labs/lab01.qmd - This is the main landing page students will see. It includes:
- Overview and data story
- Quick navigation links to all 5 parts
- Download buttons for the exercise notebook and follow-on
- Schedule and key concepts

Integrated Lab Experience (Primary Resource)
--------------------------------------------
chapters/lab1/index.qmd - This is where students should start. It links to all 5 parts.

Each Part Has:
- Slides (part1-slides.qmd, part2-slides.qmd, etc.) - Embedded RevealJS slides for you to present
- Practice Page (part1.qmd, part2.qmd, etc.) - WebR interactive practice for students
- Notebook Sections - Students work in ONE downloadable notebook (templates/lab1-exercise.qmd)

The 5 Parts
-----------
Part 1: RStudio Tour
  - Variables, vectors, functions
  - Download notebook
  - Change name, render

Part 2: Loading Data
  - read_csv(), head(), str(), dim()

Part 3: Reverse Scoring
  - Formula: 6 - original (items G1, G3, G5, G6)

Part 4: Descriptives & Plots
  - group_by(), summarise(), ggplot() boxplots

Part 5: APA Write-Up
  - Reporting M, SD, n, proactive coding

HOW TO RUN THE LAB
==================

Before the Lab
--------------
1. Open the main page: labs/lab01.qmd (or direct students to the integrated experience at chapters/lab1/index.qmd)
2. Familiarize yourself with Part 1 slides - especially the "Change Your Name and Render" section (this is their first success!)
3. Test RStudio Server access: https://psy909.gold.ac.uk/rstudioserver/

During the Lab (2 hours: 13:00-15:00)
--------------------------------------

Part 1 (13:00-13:20):
- Present slides embedded in part1.qmd
- Students practice with WebR code cells on the same page
- CRITICAL: Guide students to download the notebook and set it up in RStudio Server
- Their first task: Change "YOUR NAME HERE" to their actual name and Render (this confirms everything works!)

Parts 2-5:
- Same pattern: Slides → WebR practice → Notebook exercises
- Students continue working in the SAME notebook they downloaded in Part 1
- Each part has embedded slides you can present directly from the page

Key Technical Details
---------------------

RStudio Server:
- URL: https://psy909.gold.ac.uk/rstudioserver/
- Login format: username@campus.goldsmiths.ac.uk (full email)
- Students create a folder, upload the .qmd file, and work there

WebR (Browser Practice):
- Students can edit and run code directly in the browser
- No RStudio needed for practice sections
- Great for experimentation before moving to RStudio Server

The Notebook:
- Location: templates/lab1-exercise.qmd
- Students download it once in Part 1
- It renders successfully if untouched (good for testing)
- Code is hidden by default in rendered HTML (code-fold: true)
- Students fill in code sections marked with # YOUR CODE:

SCHEDULE BREAKDOWN
==================

13:00-13:10  Part 1 Slides - You present RStudio basics
13:10-13:20  Part 1 Practice - Students try WebR, download notebook, set up RStudio Server, change name, render
13:20-13:35  Part 2 Slides - Data loading concepts
13:35-13:50  Part 2 Practice - Students practice loading data (WebR + notebook)
13:50-14:05  Part 3 Slides - Reverse scoring explanation
14:05-14:20  Part 3 Practice - Students practice reverse scoring
14:20-14:40  Part 4 Slides - Descriptives and visualisation
14:40-14:55  Part 4 Practice - Students create plots and analyze
14:55-15:00  Wrap-up - Part 5 (APA write-up) can be completed independently

ALTERNATIVE RESOURCES (IF NEEDED)
==================================

If students want to access components separately:
- Full Slides: slides/lab1-slides.qmd (standalone slide deck)
- WebR Practice Only: chapters/lab1-webr.qmd (all interactive practice in one page)
- Follow-On Exercise: followon/lab1-followon.qmd (optional extra practice)

COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR
===========================

1. RStudio Server Login: Students must use full email format (@campus.goldsmiths.ac.uk)
2. Render Button: First-time users might not find it - it's in the top toolbar (knitting needle icon)
3. Notebook Download: Make sure students download in Part 1, not later
4. Code Visibility: Remind students that code is hidden in rendered HTML - that's intentional!
5. WebR vs RStudio: WebR is for practice, RStudio Server is for their actual work/submission

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
==================

The Grit Scale:
- Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) - 8 items
- Two subscales: Consistency of Interest (G1, G3, G5, G6 - reverse-scored) and Perseverance of Effort (G2, G4, G7, G8)
- Source article link is included in materials for interested students

Data:
- Hosted on GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleMonkeyLab/datarepo/main/Y1_Week13_Lab1_grit_data.csv
- Loads automatically when students run the first code chunk

SUPPORT RESOURCES
=================

- R Toolbox: toolbox/index.qmd - Code examples and reference
- Troubleshooting: toolbox/troubleshooting.qmd - Common errors and fixes
- Module Structure Guide: MODULE_STRUCTURE.md - Full documentation of the lab structure

QUICK CHECKLIST FOR INSTRUCTORS
================================

- Test RStudio Server access before lab
- Open chapters/lab1/index.qmd or labs/lab01.qmd
- Navigate through Part 1 slides to familiarize yourself
- Test the download button for the notebook
- Be ready to help with RStudio Server setup (login, folder creation, upload)
- Emphasize the "Change Name and Render" task as their first success
- Remind students they use ONE notebook for all 5 parts

QUESTIONS?
==========

If anything is unclear or you'd like to discuss the materials, just let me know. The website should render everything automatically - just open the .qmd files or view the rendered HTML in the docs/ folder.

Thanks, and good luck with the lab!

P.S. All materials are designed to work together seamlessly. Students should primarily use the integrated experience (chapters/lab1/index.qmd), but alternative resources are available if needed. The 3-step cycle (Watch → Try → Do) repeats for each part, so once students understand it in Part 1, they'll know what to expect.
